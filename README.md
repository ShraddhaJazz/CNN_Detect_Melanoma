## General Information
    


## Project Statement
    Preparign a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.



## Conclusions
    *Here summerising conlusions:
    - The final model still is overfitting.
    - Overfitting can be addressed by training the model on a larger dataset.
    - Model's performance may also improve by hyperparameter tuning.
